# [Cashlook](#cashlook)

A handy chrome/chromium browser extension that parses prices with their currency from the webpage and converts them to a desired currency.

## [Installation](#installation)

This extension is not on the chrome webstore yet, but if you want to run it locally, these are the steps:

1. Clone this repository  
   `git clone https://github.com/AleeyCreative/cashlook`
2. Open the extension tab in your chrome browser by typing in the address bar:
   `chrome://extensions`
3. Toggle Developer Mode ON if it is switched OFF
4. By clicking on the `Load unpacked` button, you would be prompted with an open dialog box where you can easily locate the extension folder `cashlook-master` and load it.
5. That's all

## [Usage](#usage)

Cashlook automatically adds a context menu to the browser once activated. So, if you want to quickly convert between currencies, once you highlight the value with the currency symbol in the browser and right click, you would see the cashlook menu that would bring up the cashlook modal to enable you quickly convert between currencies.

For example, a paragraph contains the following text:

> ... so the new iMac costs over $650.

If you want to convert the `$650`, simply highlight it, right-click, and select cashlook from the context menu.
